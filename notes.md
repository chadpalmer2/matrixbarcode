# Various notes regarding my project

## Ideas

### Flow chart of how transforming an image into data works with QR codes

- Image is captured
- Finder patterns determine axis of orientation, timer patterns determine skew
- Math is done to determine where each module is
- Modules are iterated over to determine theoretic matrix version of code
- Speculation: subsets of pixels associated with given module are determined, average color value take to determine bit value
